    <h1>Metaphor</h1>
    <p>
      A metaphor is a mapping from one domain to another. For example, moo is
      to cow as beep is to car. These mapping get so buried in our own language
      that we dont even notice their effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, take the language used to describe a debate:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "He shot down her ideas."
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      "She defended her position."
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      "She overwhelmed his arguments."
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      "He had to retreat from that position."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      These are all debate-as-war metaphors. Its a zero sum game. Someone wins
      and someone loses. The idea that both people could learn from each other
      just doesnt come up.
