    <h2>Alternate study environments</h2>
    <p>
      study in the library, in the coffee shop, in your own room, ... Varying
      the placeyou study helps you remember more.

    <h2>Mix content</h2>
    <p>
      Study a bit of this, a bit of that, some of this again, some of the other.
      Switching content helps you remember more.

    <h2>Space study sessions</h2>
    <p>
      Three one hour sessions is more effective than one three hour session.

      Test yourself, or have a buddy do it. It helps you know how well you know.
